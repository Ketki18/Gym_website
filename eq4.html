           <h2> <span><i class='bx bx-dumbbell'></i></span> Preacher Curl Bench</h2>
         
           <p>This bench is the perfect equipment for beginners to start their bicep training by making use of a curl bar. This equipment provides precise contraction, separating the elbow movement from the rest of the body.

            <br><br>

            Tips: <br><br>
            When you use the preacher curl bench,

            <ol class="list">
              <li>Sit with your triceps resting on the preacher bench pad and your underarms at the top of the edge.</li>
              <li>However, there are a few don'ts you need to avoid: Do not extend your arm too far; to get leverage and complete the curl, do not shift your body downwards toward the weight; do not use too much weight. This will lower the bar or dumbbell too far for down, making you lose control.</li>

            </ol>
