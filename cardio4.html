           <h2> <span><i class='bx bx-dumbbell'></i></span> Running in place
           </h2>
         
           <p>When running in place, a person moves their body as if they were running, but they stay in one spot. <br>

            A 2015 studyTrusted Source found that running in place can reduce muscle fatigue, improve aerobic exercise ability, and strengthen muscles. Researchers also note that it improved flexibility, gait, and lumbar stability. <br>
            
            Running in place can be part of an interval workout. This is where a person completes repetitions of different exercises in a set time. An example of an interval workout that includes running in place is the following: 
            <ol class="list">
              <li>Run in place for 2 minutes.</li>
              <li>Increase speed for 1 minute.
            </li>
              <li>Rest for 1 minute.
            </li>
              <li>Jog in place for 3 minutes.
            </li>
              <li>Rest for 1 minute.
            </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
