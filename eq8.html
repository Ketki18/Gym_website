           </h2>
         
           <p>This gym machine provides some of the best exercises for both upper and lower body. It's a great machine for squats, but it's great for chest press too. It's like an advanced version of a bench press. <br><br>

            The machine provides superior balance and helps you to keep your weight steady, so you can pick up from whatever position you choose to put your body in. But, if you use it incorrectly, it can put pressure on your flexors and tendons. <br><br>
            Tips: <br> <br>
            When using a smith machine,


            <ol class="list">
              <li>Do not lock your elbows as you are lifting the bar and reach the top.
            </li>
              <li>When there is no one to spot you, stay safe by turning and locking the bar.
            </li>
            
            </ol>
