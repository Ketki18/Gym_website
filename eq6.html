           <h2> <span><i class='bx bx-dumbbell'></i></span> Calf Machine</h2>
         
           <p>This machine is very common in the gym, and it is used for lifting weights with your feet by pushing it upwards.

            <br><br>

            Tips: <br><br>
            When you use the calf machine,

            <ol class="list">
              <li>Sit with your knees bent at a right angle. The balls of the feet should rest on the footrest. The heels should be free to move.
            </li>
              <li>Lift your heels as high as possible while pushing the pads on your knees as high as you can. Once you reach the peak, hold it there for a moment and then slowly release to lower your heels. All the while, make sure that you breathe normally.
            </li>
              <li>Keep the weight under control and do not bounce or take one foot off the footrest before finishing a set or starting with another one. First, lower the weight and then remove the feet.
            </li>
            </ol>
